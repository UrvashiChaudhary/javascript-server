# MERN Stack:
It is javascript stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full stack web application.
It comprises of four technologies:
1.***MongoDB:*** It is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON objects. 
MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. 
Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. 
Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well.
2. ***Express:***Express is a Node.js framework. 
Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.
3. ***React:*** React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. 
React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data.
4. ***Node.js:*** Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server

MERN is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB)

In **3-tier architectural pattern:
The top tier of the MERN stack is React.js
The next level down is the Express.js server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server
The last tier is the MongoDB Database
